However I mean a solution like in (5), where `ConnectivityService` just collect the information in its own in-memory data structure, which should be a lot simpler than going through app ops or using `DiscreteRegistry`.\n\n4. Thanks for the clarification. I was assuming by saying that you can\u0027t put the app in system_ext you meant you can\u0027t put it in any partition in the system image as well, but that\u0027s not the case. product or vendor apps indeed have access to system APIs but not hidden APIs, so you are right that creating system APIs should work.\n\n5. Yes, it seems to me if you simply collect the necessary data directly inside a new \u0026 custom data in-memory structure in `ConnectivityService`, instead of going to app ops and then somehow getting it back, the design will be much simpler, less coupled and more robust. This way we will also save the APIs. Do you think this approach will be feasible for the requirements?",

My suggestion of doing it in `ConnectivityService` makes more sense when you only need to collect information about network requests, but that no longer sound like the case after your latest clarification.\n\nSo adding these app ops sgtm as app ops owner. However to make them system API:\n\n1. Could you add more javadoc on what\u0027s expected for these new app ops? e.g. what they are exactly for, when they are noted (e.g. also link to `requestNetwork`), and that they are only supposed to be used for logging and not used for access control.\n\n2. If these app ops are only for the requirement, is `OP_REQUEST_NETWORK_TRANSPORT_DEFAULT` part of the requirement? And does it cover any type of request that\u0027s not cellular, wifi or bluetooth, or it only covers the case where the caller didn\u0027t specify an explicit preference? I\u0027m asking because since we are making this API, we need to be more careful, and I\u0027m thinking of whether this should be a `OP_REQUEST_NETWORK_TRANSPORT_DEFAULT` or `OP_REQUEST_NETWORK_TRANSPORT_OTHER`.",

So, the system app which tracks this event will check what transport is used when it receives #OnOpNotedCallback.

So, I defined \"DEFAULT\". If it is allowed to call AppOpsManager#noteOpNoThrow without checking the results of access control and use it for tracking, I can move the implementation that calls AppOpsManager#noteOpNoThrow after ConnectivityService decides on the transport.
